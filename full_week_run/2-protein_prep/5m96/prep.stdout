Opening clean_receptor.pdb...
Model 0 (clean_receptor.pdb) appears to be a protein without secondary structure assignments.
Automatically computing assignments using 'ksdssp' and parameter values:
  energy cutoff -0.5
  minimum helix length 3
  minimum strand length 3
Use command 'help ksdssp' for more information.
